<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most well-known and feared tropical disease in the Philippines is likely dengue. Dengue has been an endemic disease in Southeast Asia since the first outbreak was documented there in 1954 in Manila. In 2019, the Philippines had the highest number of dengue infections ever reported globally with 437,563 cases.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dengue is spread by various Aedes-type mosquitos, primarily A. Aegypti. The dengue virus causes dengue fever, a mosquito-borne illness. Symptoms usually appear three to four days after the occurrence. Following that, infection. Dengue fever symptoms include high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint discomfort, and a skin rash. Improvement normally takes 2 to 7 days. Dengue hemorrhagic fever symptoms include bleeding, a low blood platelet count, and the release of blood plasma, or the condition progresses to dengue shock syndrome, which causes dangerously low blood pressure.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, the Philippine government established the National Dengue Prevention and Control Program to address this rising issue. The program includes monitoring cases and vectors, diagnosing and treating cases, managing integrated vectors, responding to outbreaks, promoting good health, and doing research. The Department of Health has focused on environmental control measures, encouraging residents to form the "4 o'clock habit" of emptying water containers that could serve as Aedes breeding sites every day, as well as certain chemical control measures (fogging during outbreaks).</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DOH have implemented the 4s strategy, to help in preventing mosquito bites and avoiding dengue cases from rising. The Search and destroy mosquito-breeding sites where getting rid of or covering any standing water can help with this. The next one is Secure self-protection measures like wearing clothing that covers the majority of the body such as long pants and long sleeved shirts and daily use of mosquito repellent. Seeking early consultation is another one to know whether dengue is what is causing you to be sick. Lastly, the Support fogging or spraying only in hotspot areas where increases in cases is registered for two consecutive weeks to prevent an outbreak. Living in an air-conditioned or well-screened home can help and be cautious if a member of your family becomes dengue fever.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a part of the nation's efforts to prevent dengue, the Dengvaxia vaccine was introduced in 2016. Unfortunately, Sanofi, the company that developed the vaccine, stated that people who have never had dengue infection may experience "more severe disease" after receiving Dengvaxia, almost two years after the campaign had begun. At this point, more than 800,000 kids had been inoculated without parental consent. As a result of the widespread outrage that followed, lawsuits were filed against Sanofi and various government figures on the grounds that the vaccine had killed children and that the government was corrupt. As a result of the growing mistrust people had for the public health system, immunization rates fell, which led to a measles outbreak in 2019.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 110 nations regularly commemorate the Second World War. Between 50 and 528 million individuals become ill each year, and Dengue causes about 20,000 deaths annually. Dengue fever is caused by any of four distinct serotypes (DENV 1-4) of single-stranded RNA viruses of the genusÂ Flavivirus. Infection by one serotype results in lifelong immunity to that serotype but not to others. More than 100 million people are affected each year by this virus, which has the fastest global spread of any mosquito-borne disease. Additionally, dengue, which is present in more than 100 countries, kills 20 to 25,000 people every year, mostly children.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippines Department of Health has issued the final dengue fever data for 2023, with a total of 29,885 cases reported as of 25 March 2023, epidemiological week 12. When compared to the same period in 2022, the number of instances is 85% greater (n=16,154). From 1 January to 25 March 2023, there were 96 fatalities (CFR 0.3%), which is more than the previous week's 92 deaths (CFR 0.3%) but fewer than the 107 deaths (CFR 0.7%) for the same time in 2022.</p>
