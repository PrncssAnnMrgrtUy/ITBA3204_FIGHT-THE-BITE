<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most well-known and feared tropical disease in the Philippines is likely dengue. Dengue has been an endemic disease in Southeast Asia since the first outbreak was documented there in 1954 in Manila. In 2019, the Philippines had the highest number of dengue infections ever reported globally with 437,563 cases.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dengue is spread by various Aedes-type mosquitos, primarily A. Aegypti. The dengue virus causes dengue fever, a mosquito-borne illness. Symptoms usually appear three to four days after the occurrence. Following that, infection. Dengue fever symptoms include high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint discomfort, and a skin rash. Improvement normally takes 2 to 7 days. Dengue hemorrhagic fever symptoms include bleeding, a low blood platelet count, and the release of blood plasma, or the condition progresses to dengue shock syndrome, which causes dangerously low blood pressure.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, the Philippine government established the National Dengue Prevention and Control Program to address this rising issue. The program includes monitoring cases and vectors, diagnosing and treating cases, managing integrated vectors, responding to outbreaks, promoting good health, and doing research. The Department of Health has focused on environmental control measures, encouraging residents to form the "4 o'clock habit" of emptying water containers that could serve as Aedes breeding sites every day, as well as certain chemical control measures (fogging during outbreaks).</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DOH have implemented the 4s strategy, to help in preventing mosquito bites and avoiding dengue cases from rising. The Search and destroy mosquito-breeding sites where getting rid of or covering any standing water can help with this. The next one is Secure self-protection measures like wearing clothing that covers the majority of the body such as long pants and long sleeved shirts and daily use of mosquito repellent. Seeking early consultation is another one to know whether dengue is what is causing you to be sick. Lastly, the Support fogging or spraying only in hotspot areas where increases in cases is registered for two consecutive weeks to prevent an outbreak. Living in an air-conditioned or well-screened home can help and be cautious if a member of your family becomes dengue fever.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a part of the nation's efforts to prevent dengue, the Dengvaxia vaccine was introduced in 2016. Unfortunately, Sanofi, the company that developed the vaccine, stated that people who have never had dengue infection may experience "more severe disease" after receiving Dengvaxia, almost two years after the campaign had begun. At this point, more than 800,000 kids had been inoculated without parental consent. As a result of the widespread outrage that followed, lawsuits were filed against Sanofi and various government figures on the grounds that the vaccine had killed children and that the government was corrupt. As a result of the growing mistrust people had for the public health system, immunization rates fell, which led to a measles outbreak in 2019.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 110 nations regularly commemorate the Second World War. Between 50 and 528 million individuals become ill each year, and Dengue causes about 20,000 deaths annually. Dengue fever is caused by any of four distinct serotypes (DENV 1-4) of single-stranded RNA viruses of the genusÂ Flavivirus. Infection by one serotype results in lifelong immunity to that serotype but not to others. More than 100 million people are affected each year by this virus, which has the fastest global spread of any mosquito-borne disease. Additionally, dengue, which is present in more than 100 countries, kills 20 to 25,000 people every year, mostly children.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippines Department of Health has issued the final dengue fever data for 2023, with a total of 29,885 cases reported as of 25 March 2023, epidemiological week 12. When compared to the same period in 2022, the number of instances is 85% greater (n=16,154). From 1 January to 25 March 2023, there were 96 fatalities (CFR 0.3%), which is more than the previous week's 92 deaths (CFR 0.3%) but fewer than the 107 deaths (CFR 0.7%) for the same time in 2022.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being</strong></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this SDG is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. It highlights the need for health education and awareness, particularly in communities where services are lacking. This is especially true in the case of dengue, where understanding of preventative measures and early warning signals can assist people and communities in taking action to prevent the disease's spread.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation</strong></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This SDG ensures availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. It is critical for dengue prevention and control. We can minimize the prevalence of the disease and promote community health and well-being just like the Goal 3 of the SDGs, by providing access to clean water and sanitation.</p>

<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</h3>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Philippines, dengue fever is one of the most serious health problems. Most outbreaks in the nation take place during the wet season (June to February), which is largely seasonal. All four DENV serotypes are currently circulating in the Philippines, which also has the highest density of dengue outbreaks in Southeast Asia. The virus that causes dengue fever is spread by infected mosquitoes to other mosquito species, where it causes dengue fever. There isn't a dengue fever vaccine available right now in the Philippines. Therefore, the best way to stop the spread of the illness is to avoid its possible causes. Aedes population reduction is the only obvious method of preventing dengue fever. In order to reduce the presence of Aedes, it is essential to comprehend their environment.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Dengue Prevention and Control Program is established in 1993 by the Philippine government to address the growing problem regarding dengue cases. However, the program struggled achieving its goals for reducing dengue cases. The lack of empowerment among the stakeholders to take responsibility for dengue prevention is a major obstacle to its effectiveness. The difficulty of eliminating local breeding grounds, which are mostly water-holding containers, was another issue that was confronted. Residents store water in these containers in locations with erratic piped water supply. Furthermore, inhabitants frequently save various containers because they can be used for other things or even sold to generate revenue. Ineffective waste collection services may leave garbage lying where it can collect rainfall is another problem.</p>


<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water storage is critical in some areas where pure water is scarce as well. However, there are chances where stored water also serves as a breeding ground for dengue mosquitoes. As a result, poor home water management and sanitation are possible risk factors for the dengue illness. Little is known about the role of stored water in the risk of dengue, but it would be critical to create coordinated control and management measures. Even less is known about the impact of including disease control in educational settings. The treatments for dengue fever is also being studied to see if it can reduce the dengue entomological risk factors as well.</p>


<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dengvaxia vaccine was first introduced in 2016 as part of the nation's efforts to prevent dengue. However, Sanofi, the company that developed the vaccine, revealed that Dengvaxia might result in 'more severe disease' to individuals who have never had dengue infection, almost two years after the campaign had begun. Public outrage followed the indiscriminate vaccination of over 800,000 kids at this point, and lawsuits were brought against Sanofi and different government figures over allegations of child vaccine deaths and political corruption. The subsequent lack of confidence in the public health sector caused immunization rates to drop significantly, which led to an outbreak of measles in 2019.</p>

<h3>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT</h3> 

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>To the Students.</strong> Students would be able to learn about their present health and make improvements in their schools and communities as a result. It could motivate them to advise and assist minorities in maintaining a clean environment in order to reduce the incidence of dengue in both public and private settings, including their schools, parks, and even in their homes. This information will show how unclean and disorderly surroundings can have an effect on even a clean community. They will learn to value their environment as a result of this.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>To the Local Government Unit (LGU).</strong> This will help them analyze the data and identify the particular areas and age groups that Dengue most frequently affects in their locality. Additionally, it will enhance their response and motivate them to put policies in place to stop dengue cases in nearby municipalities and barangays. Create initiatives with the help of the federal government, including the Department of Health (DOH).</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>To the Citizens and the Community.</strong> The project can help the citizens and community by providing data and information on how they can prevent dengue cases. It can especially help the parents and guardians. This would teach parents and guardians on how to keep their families safe by working with their own local barangay and town officials and helping LGUs maintain their environment. The proper safety of their children's health should be a parent's or guardian's first priority and duty.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>To the Future Researchers.</strong> The information and analysis available in this study that is created by the proponents can help the future researchers to better understand the problem regarding dengue. The project can guide them and provide needed data for a more in-depth study. This can give them an overview about the topic on how the Philippines is dealing with the rising cases of dengue.</p>

***

<h3>METHODS</h3>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers will gather, organize, and use available data-sets such as those provided from Our World in Data to analyze the rising cases of dengue in the Philippines. The categories such as month, year, region, and number of dengue cases will be available in the said data-sets. These data-sets can help the researchers to understand how and when, during what months these cases of dengue are rising the most. All members of the Literature Review Group have access to the original data sources and extraction tables for them to be able to review and analyze it more anytime, anywhere.</p>

***

<h3>EXPECTED OUTPUT</h3>
  
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project intends to educate people about the dengue epidemic in the Philippines. It will contain the information regarding how many cases have been recorded in the past years, why and what causes dengue to be present in an environment, and what steps will be taken to avoid the rise of dengue cases. The data gathered and results from this project can help anyone who will view or use it for future research. This can help the future researchers, the Department of Health, the Local Government Unit such as the barangay, and the health care workers as well. Through the gathered data in this project, the Department of health can use it to better understand the problem regarding dengue. This can help them to provide guidelines and better solutions or steps on how each community can avoid having a high percentage of dengue cases. Issuing those guidelines and steps on how to be safe from being bitten by a dengue mosquito to communities can help in curbing the dengue cases down.<p>
